# EchoTrans
EchoTrans is a Deep Learning-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) engine designed to bridge the language gap between English and Marathi. Unlike simple word-to-word translators, this engine uses a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture to understand the context of an entire sentence before generating a translation.
